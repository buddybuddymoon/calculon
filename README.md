## Introduction

**Calculon** is an online calculator which has all the basic functionalities of a normal calculator. 
On top of the basic computing functionalities, it is planned to be expanded to fully functioning online graphing/scientific calculator which will plot custom functions. A nice feature to have on top of this would be allowing users to be able to store previous answers and custom graphs by logging in.

It was determined that making such calculator is good practice for learning:
1. How to develop and launch a web application. 
2. Learn about Django + Heroku as backend and HTML + CSS + JavaScript for frontend. 
3. Learn how to use version control using Git.
4. Learn how to collaborate with other people in brainstorming, designing, delegating, and building software.

It was initially started as a good side project to practice the above points by Ted Shin, Moon Lee, and YJ Lee.
