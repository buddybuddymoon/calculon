## Introduction

**Calculon** is an online calculator which has all the basic functionalities of a normal calculator. 
On top of the basic computing functionalities, it is planned to be expanded to fully functioning online graphing/scientific calculator which will plot custom functions. A nice feature to have on top of this would be allowing users to be able to store previous answers and custom graphs by logging in.

It was determined that making such calculator is good practice for learning:
1. How to develop and launch a web application. 
2. Learn about Django + Heroku as backend and HTML + CSS + JavaScript for frontend. 
3. Learn how to use version control using Git.
4. Learn how to collaborate with other people by brainstorming ideas, designing features, delegating tasks, and finally building software together.

It was initially started as a side project to practice the above by Ted Shin, Moon Lee, and YJ Lee.

*Development Methods*
1. **Technology:** Django for Backend, Heroku for Server, HTML + CSS + JavaScript for Frontend and AWS for client data storage.
* From previous experience, for small projects like this, Heroku and Django works great..  and HTML, CSS, JS are bread-butter of web app development

2. **Version Control:** Git
* This is No Brainer thesedays. [Good reference](https://buddy.works/blog/5-types-of-git-workflows)

3. **Development Method:** Agile 
* We start with really basic functionalities, test, release and keep improving using barebones [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

## Core Features

The core features of **Calculon** is the basic calculation function similar to your run of the mill built-in windows calculator
